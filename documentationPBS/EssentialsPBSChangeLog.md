## List of all the changes to PBS files from v15 to v20

## v20

### File structure

- Renamed various PBS files.
- Removed support for the PBS file tm.txt.
- Added "Flags" properties to abilities, map metadata, ribbons, species, trainer types and types.
- Abilities that hasten egg hatching now have a flag in abilities.txt for this effect.
- Removed support for old encounters.txt format.
- Added PBS file pokemon_metrics.txt, for all Pok√©mon sprite positionings. Can be distributed with sprite pack resources.
- Added new section-based format for ribbons.txt, trainer_types.txt, moves.txt, items.txt, berry_plants.txt.
- Added new section-based format for shadow_pokemon.txt, which can now also define heart gauge sizes and flags.

#### items.txt:
- Added separate "SellPrice" property for items.
- Added "Consumable" property to items.txt.
- An item can now have any number of flags, rather than just one.


#### metadata.txt:
- Split metadata.txt into metadata.txt and map_metadata.txt. Player character data is now in separate sections in metadata.txt, one per character, and you can now have as many characters as you like. NOTE: If you're using old PBS files, you will need to make these changes manually (move map metadata sections into map_metadata.txt without changing them, and move player character metadata into their own sections). Also, calls to pbChangePlayer will need to have their numbers increased by 1.
- Added "Name" property to map_metadata.txt, which is the display name in-game.
- Added map metadata flag "HideEncountersInPokedex" which will make the Pok√©dex ignore that map‚Äôs wild encounters when displaying a Pok√©mon‚Äôs area.


#### pokemon.txt/pokemon_forms.txt:
- Changed the names of some properties in pokemon.txt and pokemon_forms.txt.
- Merged species "Type1"/"Type2" into "Types".
- The "EVs" property's preferred format is now "ATTACK,2,SPEED,1" instead of "0,2,0,1,0,0".
- Allowed the "WildItem" properties for species to contain multiple items each.
- Added pokemon.txt/pokemon_forms.txt property "Offspring" for species that can be produced by breeding instead of itself (although this property can include itself anyway).



### Property changed

#### items.txt:
- Repels now have a flag in items.txt which determines if they can be reused when one runs out.
- Added flags for Fling power and Natural Gift type/power.

#### metadata.txt:
- When rewriting map_metadata.txt via the Debug function, map names will be added if possible and if the map doesn't already have a name in map_metadata.txt.

#### pokemon.txt/pokemon_forms.txt:
- Added species flags that govern form inheritance while breeding, and a flag that sets a particular form by default.
- Renumbered Spiky-Eared Pichu to form 2, so it doesn't clash with Alolan Raichu's form 1.
- The "Shape" property in pokemon.txt must now be a name and not a number.

#### moves.txt:
- Deprecated three move flags (can Magic Coat, can Snatch, affected by King's Rock) as they should depend on move effects instead.
- Turned move flags into separate words rather than letters in a string.
- Added move flag "TramplesMinimize" instead of having that effect be related to function codes.
- Added move flag "CannotMetronome" instead of hardcoding the signature moves Metronome is forbidden to use.

#### trainers.txt:
Removed support for the old trainers.txt format.
The "Ability" property in trainers.txt can now only be an ability ID.
The "Ball" property in trainers.txt can now only be an item ID (specifically an item that is a Pok√© Ball).
Added Gen 6 PBS files for completeness.

### Property changed
#### "moves.txt"
