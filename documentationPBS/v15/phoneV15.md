All phone calls are arrangements of up to three different kinds of dialogue:

**Greetings ,GreetingsMorning ,GreetingsEvening:**  
The first part of all phone calls. The rest of a phone call is one of the below three options.

**Bodies1 ,Bodies2:**  
These two bits of dialogue are always used together.

**Generics:**  
This is a complete phone call in itself, minus the "Greetings" part.

**BattleRequests:**  
A phrase which declares that the caller is ready for a rematch.

### Examples
Each dialogue type has its own section, and each possible dialogue is written on a separate line

```
[<GreetingsEvening>]
\PN, good evening!  Hi.\mThis is \TN.
[<Greetings>]
Hello.  This is \TN.
Good day, \PN!  Hi.  This is \TN.
How are you doing? \PN, howdy!  This is \TN.  Isn't it nice out?
\PN, good day!  It's me, \TN.  Got a minute?
Hello, \PN.  This is \TN.  How are things?
[<Bodies1>]
How are your Pokemon doing?\mMy \TP's really energetic.  It's a handful!
How are your Pokemon doing?\mI always keep my \TP in top shape by going to Pokemon Centers.
My \TP's looking really awesome.  I wish I could show you.
I dressed my \TP and it looks even cuter than before.
[<Bodies2>]
Oh yeah, I managed to beat a tough \TE.\mI need to make my party stronger.
You have to hear this!  I battled \TE the other day.\mIt was easy!  I had a type advantage.
Hey, listen!  I almost caught \TE the other day.\mOh, it was sooooooo close, too!
Guess what happened the other day.  I missed catching \TE again.\mMaybe I'm not very good at this.
