**1. ID Number**:  
This number must be different for each item. It must be a whole number between 1 and 65535 (it cannot be 0). You can skip numbers (e.g. the sequence 23,24,25,197,198,199,... is allowed). The order in which items are numbered is not important.
**2. Internal name:**  	
This is how the scripts refer to the item. Typically this is the item name, but written in all capital letters and with no spaces or symbols. The internal name is never seen by the player.

**3. Display name:**  	
The name of the item, as seen by the player.

**4. üü¢ Plural display name**  
The plural form of the name of the item, as seen by the player.

**5. Pocket:**  
The Bag pocket number the item is stored in. By default, is one of:
1. - Items
2. - Medicine
3. - Pok√© Balls
4. - TMs & HMs
5. - Berries
6. - Mail
7. - Battle Items
8. - Key Items

**6. Price:**  	
The cost of the item when the player buys it from a Pok√© Mart. Note that when the player sells the item to a Pok√© Mart, it is sold for half this price (by default). If an item has a price of 0, the player cannot sell it.

**7. Description:**  
The item's description. Quote marks are only required if there is a comma in the description, but there's no harm adding them in anyway. If there are any quote marks in the description itself, you must put a backslash before each of them, e.g. \". The same applies if there are any apostrophes in the description and you haven't surrounded it with quote marks.
Typically, TMs and HMs will have the same description as the moves they teach, but they don't need to.

**8. Usability out of battle:**  
Is one of the following values:
0. - The item cannot be used out of battle.
1. - The item can be used on a Pok√©mon, and disappears after use (e.g. Potions, Elixirs). The party screen will appear when using this item, allowing you to choose the Pok√©mon to use it on. Not for TMs and HMs, though.
2. - The item can be used out of battle, but it isn't used on a Pok√©mon (e.g. Repel, Escape Rope, usable Key Items).
3. - The item is a TM. It teaches a move to a Pok√©mon, and disappears after use.
4. - The item is a HM. It teaches a move to a Pok√©mon, but does not disappear after use.
5. - The item can be used on a Pok√©mon, but it does not disappear after use (e.g. Pok√© Flute).

**9. Usability in battle:**  
Is one of the following values:
0. - The item cannot be used in battle.
1. - The item can be used on one of your party Pok√©mon, and disappears after use (e.g. Potions, Elixirs). The party screen will appear when using this item, allowing you to choose the Pok√©mon to use it on.
2. - The item is a Pok√© Ball, or the item can be used directly (e.g. X Accuracy et al, Pok√© Doll).
3. - The item can be used on a Pok√©mon, but does not disappear after use (e.g. Pok√© Flute).
4. - The item can be used directly, but does not disappear after use.
**10. Special items:**  	
Is one of the following values:
0. - The item is none of the items below.
1. - The item is a Mail item.
2. - The item is a Mail item, and the images of the holder and two other party Pok√©mon appear on the Mail.
3. - The item is a Snag Ball (i.e. it can capture enemy trainers' Shadow Pok√©mon).
4. - The item is a Pok√© Ball item.
5. - The item is a berry that can be planted.
6. - The item is a Key Item
**11. TM/HM move:**  
This field is for TMs and HMs only, and contains the internal name of the move that it teaches.


### Examples
```
217,POTION,Potion,2,300,"A spray-type medicine for wounds. It restores the HP of one Pok√©mon by just 20 points.",1,1,0
This is a typical item. It goes in the "Medicine" pocket of the Bag (pocket 2), costs $300 to buy (and sells for $150), and is usable both in and outside battle (and disappears after use).

12,FIRESTONE,Fire Stone,1,2100,"A peculiar stone that makes certain species of Pok√©mon evolve. It is colored orange.",1,0,0,
This is an evolution stone. It is defined exactly the same way as a regular item. It is usable on a Pok√©mon outside of battle, but it cannot be used in battle.

288,TM01,TM01,4,3000,"The user sharpens its claws to boost its Attack stat and accuracy.",3,0,0,HONECLAWS
This is a TM. It goes in the "TMs & HMs" pocket of the Bag (pocket 4), costs $3000 to buy (and sells for $1500), is not usable in battle, and teaches the move Hone Claws.

HMs are defined in exactly the same way, except field number 7 (the one immediately after the description) contains the number "4" instead of "3".

510,TOWNMAP,Town Map,8,0,"A very convenient map that can be viewed anytime. It even shows your present location.",2,0,6
This is a Key Item. It goes in the "Key Items" pocket of the Bag (pocket 8), has a price of $0 (and thus cannot be bought; it can't be sold because it is a Key Item), can be used out of battle by itself (i.e. not on a Pok√©mon), and cannot be used in battle.
