The PBS file "trainer_types.txt" lists all the defined trainer types in the game. Each section in this file is one separate trainer type, where a section begins with a line containing an ID in square brackets and ends when the next section begins. Each line in a section is one separate piece of information about that trainer type.

ðŸŸ¡ Aside from the ID line, every line in a section follows the format:
```
XXX = YYY
```

where XXX is a property and YYY is the value or values associated with it (the spaces are optional).

**[ID]**
This is how the scripts refer to the trainer type. Each trainer type must have a different ID. Typically this is the same as the trainer type's name, but written in all capital letters and with no spaces or special characters. In the scripts, the ID is used as a symbol (i.e. with a colon in front of it, e.g. :SISANDBRO). The ID is never seen by the player.
This line must come first in a section, because, as mentioned above, this line defines when a new section begins.

**ðŸ”´ Internal Name:**

**Name:**

**Skill Level:**
The skill level of all trainers of this type, used for battle AI. Higher numbers represent higher skill levels. Is 0 or a positive number. By default, the highest value that makes a difference to the AI is 100.
