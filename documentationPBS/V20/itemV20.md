## üü° items.txt

Information pulled from the new wiki:

The PBS file "items.txt" lists all the defined items in the game. Each section in this file is one separate item, where a section begins with a line containing an ID in square brackets and ends when the next section begins. Each line in a section is one separate piece of information about that item.

üü° Aside from the ID line, every line in a section follows the format:

```
XXX = YYY
```

where XXX is a property and YYY is the value or values associated with it (the spaces are optional).

**[ID]**:
This is how the scripts refer to the item. Each item must have a different ID. Typically this is the same as the item name, but written in all capital letters and with no spaces or special characters. In the scripts, the ID is used as a symbol (i.e. with a colon in front of it, e.g. :POTION). The ID is never seen by the player.
This line must come first in a section, because, as mentioned above, this line defines when a new section begins.

In Bag pockets that auto-sort themselves, items will be sorted in the same order that they are defined in the PBS file "items.txt".

**üî¥ Internal name:**
