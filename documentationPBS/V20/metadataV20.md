The PBS file "metadata.txt" contains various information used throughout the game (global metadata), as well as information about the defined player characters.
Each section in this file is either the global metadata or one separate player character, where a section begins with a line containing a number in square brackets and ends when the next section begins. Each line in a section is one separate piece of metadata.
Aside from the square bracketed number line, every line in a section follows the format:
```
XXX = YYY
```

where XXX is a property and YYY is the value or values associated with it (the spaces are optional).

### Global metadata

The first section of the PBS file "metadata.txt" begins with [0], and contains various general information about the game.

**ðŸ”´ PlayerA ,PlayerB ,PlayerC ,PlayerD ,PlayerE ,PlayerF ,PlayerG ,PlayerH:**
REMOVED

**ðŸŸ¢ StartMoney:**
The amount of money that the player starts the game with. If undefined, this is 3000.

**ðŸŸ¢ StartItemStorage:**
A comma-separated set of IDs of items that are in the player's PC at the start of the game. If undefined, there are no items there.

**Home:**
The point that the player is transferred to when they black out but no PokÃ© Center has been visited yet. This line consists of four comma-separated numbers in the following order:
1. Map ID
2. X coordinate on that map
3. Y coordinate on that map
4. Direction the player should face (2=down, 4=left, 6=right, 8=up, 0=retain direction)
The map identified by this metadata must have an event page with the "Autorun" trigger, which depends on the Game Switch called "Starting Over" (number 1 by default). This event page, when run, must heal all PokÃ©mon in the player's party (use the event command "Recover All: Entire Party" for this), and then turn that Game Switch OFF again.

This metadata is required.

**StorageCreator:**
The name of the person that created the PokÃ©mon storage system. The storage system will be called "Someone's PC" until the player has met this person, and afterwards it will be called "<name>'s PC".

**WildBattleBGM:**
The default music that plays during wild PokÃ©mon battles. It should be placed in the "Audio/BGM" directory.

**TrainerBattleBGM:**
The default music that plays during trainer battles. It should be placed in the "Audio/BGM" directory.

**ðŸŸ¡ WildVictoryBGM:**
The default victory music that plays at the end of a won wild PokÃ©mon battle. It should be placed in the "Audio/ME" directory.

**ðŸŸ¡ TrainerVictoryBGM:**
The default victory music that plays at the end of a won Trainer battle. It should be placed in the "Audio/ME" directory.

**WildCaptureME:**
The default capture music that plays at the end of a captured PokÃ©mon battle. It should be placed in the "Audio/ME" directory.

**SurfBGM:**
The background music that plays while the player is surfing.

**TrainerType:**

**WalkCharset:**
This player character's walking charset, as found in "Graphics/Characters".

**RunCharset:**
This player character's running charset, as found in "Graphics/Characters". If undefined, the WalkCharset will be used instead when running.

**SurfCharset:**
This player character's surfing charset, as found in "Graphics/Characters". If undefined, the CycleCharset will be used instead when surfing.
