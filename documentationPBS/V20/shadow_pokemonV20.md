The PBS file "shadow_pokemon.txt" lists a number of Pok√©mon species, and each one has a defined Heart Gauge size and a set of moves it will know when it becomes a Shadow Pok√©mon (i.e. when it is created).

**[Species]:**
The shadow pokemon original species.

**üü¢ GaugeSize:**
The default Heart Gauge size is 4000. Stronger Pok√©mon typically have larger Heart Gauges, which require more work to empty before they can be purified.

**Moves:**
A coma separated list of moves.
If a species is not given one or more moves it will know as a Shadow Pok√©mon, then it will know the move Shadow Rush. If Shadow Rush is not defined, the Shadow Pok√©mon of that species will have the usual moves it would know if it was not a Shadow Pok√©mon.

### Example
